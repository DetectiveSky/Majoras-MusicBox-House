# Majoras-MusicBox-House
The .zip here contains the resources required for custom music sequences for the Ocarina of Time & Majoras Mask Randomizer.

To be able to use the MMR-Sequences in OoTR please read the "create_mm_audiobin" Readme.

# Requests
If there is a song you would like converted to AudioSeq format and added to the repository, feel free to request it by opening an issue and request it there.

# Issues with Sequences

Should you find yourself or in a stream that a track is too loud or too quiet, please also feel free to either open an issue or contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/EVpd499gkS) in the appropriate channel.


# Submissions
The best way to submit your own AudioSeqs is by following the [GitKraken guide on the randomizer's wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=GitKraken). As long as the AudioSeq works and doesn't have any objectively bad audio issues it will be merged in.

If you believe a sequence can be better adapted you can either contact the original author and collaborate on improving it to replace the current one, or submit it as a second AudioSeq and meta file with either a number appended to the end (Song Title-2.seq) or a short identifier such as your/your username's initials. (Song Title-dj.seq)

You can also submit a true remix or original creation if you do not wish to recreate a piece of music entirely.


# DMCA-Critical Sequences
Use them at your own risk.
